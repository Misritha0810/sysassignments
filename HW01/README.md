# Systems Programming - Homework 1 Assignment

## Overview
The C Program is basically combination of various functions which were implemented to complete the Assignment requirements. To meet the requirements I have implemented Prime check, reverse number, min, mean, max calculations and multiple other small numerical functions.To make the user testing simple and easy, I have created a command line user menu options from which they can choose and provide inputs easily.


## Functions

### isNumberPrime
This method determines if a given number is prime.

### identifyPrecedingPrime
This method determines the prime number that is below a given input.

### calculateDigitTotal
Thus method determines the sum of the digits in a given number by using digits.

### numberTransformer
This method performs various transformations on a number based on specified conditions from the homework assignment given.

### UABNumber
This method determines if a number is a UAB number.

### reverseNum
This method reverses the digits of a given number and returns reversed number.

### smallerThanIndex
This method calculates the count of the elements in an array that are smaller than their respective indices.

### arrayDetails
This method determines details of an array, such as the low/min value, its index, mean, max/high value, and its index.

## Usage

   1. Compile the code using a C compiler.
   2. Run the executable file by following below commands given.
   3. Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number.
   4. Follow the user prompts on command line to provide input.

   a. **Compile and run:**
      ```bash
      gcc -o hw1 mmaridi_HW01.c -- Compilation command

      ./hw1  -- Running executable file command


## Menu Options

1. **numberTransformer**
   - Transforms the input number based on various conditions.

2. **UABNumber check**
   - Checks if a number is a UAB number.

3. **reverseNum**
   - Reverses the digits of a given number.

4. **smallerThanIndex**
   - Counts elements in an array smaller than their respective indices.

5. **arrayDetails**
   - Provides details about an array, including minimum value, index, mean, maximum value, and index.

6. **Exit**
   - Exits the program.
