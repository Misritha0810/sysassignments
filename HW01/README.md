# Number Operations Program Readme

## Overview
This C program includes various functions for number operations, such as prime checking, reversing digits, and array analysis. The main function allows user input to test these functions interactively.

## Functions

### isNumberPrime
This method determines if a given number is prime.

### identifyPrecedingPrime
This method determines the prime number that is below a given input.

### calculateDigitTotal
Thus method determines the sum of the digits in a given number by using digits.

### numberTransformer
This method performs various transformations on a number based on specified conditions from the homework assignment given.

### UABNumber
This method determines if a number is a UAB number.

### reverseNum
This method reverses the digits of a given number and returns reversed number.

### smallerThanIndex
This method calculates the count of the elements in an array that are smaller than their respective indices.

### arrayDetails
This method determines details of an array, such as the low/min value, its index, mean, max/high value, and its index.

## Usage

   1. Compile the code using a C compiler.
   2. Run the executable file.
   3. Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number.
   4. Follow the user prompts on command line to provide input.
   5. Verify the results for the selected operation from the given assignment input values.

   a. **Compile and run:**
      ```bash
      gcc -o hw1 mmaridi_HW01.c
      ./hw1
