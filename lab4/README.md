This program concatenates the contents of two files while ensuring that the filenames are not the same and not deleting content of second file.

   It takes two filenames as command-line arguments: <file1> and <file2>.
   Validate if the provided filenames are different to avoid overwriting the source file.
   Opens the first file in append mode, allowing for data to be written at the end.
   Opens the second file for reading its contents.
   Copies data from the second file to the first file in chunks.
